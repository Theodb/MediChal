<p>The malaria is a disease that is spread by a bite of an infected female mosquito. The malaria is caused by the Plasmodium which is a genus of parasites. We know five types of Plasmodium that can infect humans. The malaria is a global concern, every 2 minutes, a child dies of malaria. And each year, more than 200 million new cases of the disease are reported, mostly in Africa. The early diagnosis could help treat and control the disease.</p>

<p>Once the human get infected by the malaria, the Plasmodium parasite begin to spread and appears in the host&rsquo;s blood. By detecting this Plasmodium through a blood smear test and the &rdquo;thick drop&rdquo; method, it is possible to know whether a human has contracted the malaria.</p>
<p>In this challenge you will have access to pre-processed images of segmented cells from the thin blood smear slide. Your goal is to detect parasitized cell images from uninfected ones in order to diagnose malaria.</p>
