<h1>Data</h1>

<p>
        For this challenge we decided to use a dataset from the National Institutes of
        Health (NIH) which is the primary agency of the United States government
        responsible for biomedical and public health research. This dataset includes a
        total of 27,558 cell images with equal instances of parasitized and uninfected
        cells. Some examples below

    But we already extracted features for you &#128526;, you can find them on the starting kit.

    <ul>
        <li> pixels variance on each color for each image</li>
        <li> pixels means on each color for each image </li>
<<<<<<< HEAD
        <li> pixel max and min on each color for each image</li>
        <li> pixels variance, mean, max and min  for each image put in gray level</li>
        <li> everything above but whithout black pixels</li>
