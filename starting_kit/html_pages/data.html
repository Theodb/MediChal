<h1>Data</h1>
<p>For this challenge we decided to use a dataset from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) which is the primary agency of the United States government responsible for biomedical and public health research. This dataset includes a total of 27,558 cell images with equal instances of parasitized and uninfected cells. Some exemples below</p>

<p>You can download the dataset with the following <a href="https://lhncbc.nlm.nih.gov/publication/pub9932?fbclid=IwAR12dfZcecfJaw5jJ5OJKtSnU-_2Cm0pRWAVGGA0WE7dPCWNB6RhxUOOhDU">link</a>. The format is <a href="https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/2321">autoML</a>.</p>
<p>But we extracted features for you ðŸ˜Ž , you can find them on the starting kit.</p>
<ul>
<li>pixels variances on each color for each image</li>
<li>pixels means on each color for each image</li>
<li>pixel max and min on each color for each image</li>
<li>pixels variance, means, max and min for each image put in gray level</li>
<li>every thing above but whithout black pixels</li>
<li>Xinneng's feature</li>
</ul>
