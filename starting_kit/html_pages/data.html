<p>But we extracts features for you ðŸ˜Ž , you can find them on the starting kit.</p>
<ul>
<li>pixels variances on each color for each image</li>
<li>pixels means on each color for each image</li>
<li>pixel max and min on each color for each image</li>
<li>pixels variance, means, max and min for each image put in gray level</li>
<li>every thing above but whithout black pixels</li>
<li>Xinneng's feature</li>
</ul>
